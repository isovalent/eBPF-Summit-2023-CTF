  Welcome to the eBPF Summit 2023 !!
  ------
  You can connect to your running instance with the command:
  lima shell hard

  Once within your running VM, you will see (with root (you can use sudo)) that the /ebpf.summit file is being
  continually updated. You will need to identify the program that is accessing that file, the program is also
  reading /etc/passwd every second. Once you find the program and it's pid you should be able to kill the program!

  Only then will the /ebpf.summit reveal the winning code.
